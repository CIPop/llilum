# Using this sample
#

This sample is built on top of the mBed Application Board, and uses the on-board I2C temperature sensor. Based on the temperature reading, LEDs on the LPC1768
board light up (the warmer, the more LEDs light up). Users can make the temperature "change" by placing a finger on the temperature sensor. If no LEDs light up,
change the values for TEMP0-3 to be tailored to the user's environment
